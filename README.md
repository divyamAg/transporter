# transporter
It is a RC bot which is used to transport any object within the size of 8x8 inches. Arduino is used as the micro controller in the bot and esp32 is used in the remote for controlling the bot. This project showcases the development of an Arduino and ESP32-powered RC car, designed to offer an immersive and customizable remote control experience. The core of this project lies in the fusion of Arduino's versatility with ESP32's wireless capabilities, enabling precise control, and smartphone app integration. With a focus on expandability, we've integrated features like customizable LED lighting, a rugged design for various terrains
